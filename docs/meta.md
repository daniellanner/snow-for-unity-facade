## Report a bug

There are two options on how to report a bug, depending if you have a Github account.

### Report via Github

Should you encounter a bug or have a feature request please open a issue on the SnowFS for Unity [Github repository](https://github.com/daniellanner/snowfs-for-unity/issues). Please read through open issues first to see if your problem has already been reported and follow the guidelines on how to report issues.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter. 

### Report via bug report tool 

If you have no Github account, we still value your input :bug::heart:. You can use the *SnowFS bug report tool* by selecting *Report a bug* in the extended menu of the editor window.

To add more context to your report you may choose to share your logfile. Since log files may sometimes contain sensitive information the report tool offers a **Find and Replace** option.
